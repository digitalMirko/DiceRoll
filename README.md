# DiceRoll

Created in Android Studio 3.0.1, run on Nexus 4 Android Emulator

This is a simple dice rolling app. When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app and 
are greeted with a Dice Roll title graphic at the top. Followed by a middle section with two red dice and on the bottom
with two buttons. The one on the left clears the roll and the one on the right rolls the die.
